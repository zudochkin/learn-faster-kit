# FASTER Learning System - Instructions

## System Overview

This project uses the FASTER framework:

-   **F**orget: Beginner's mindset
-   **A**ct: Hands-on practice
-   **S**tate: Optimize focus
-   **T**each: Explain to retain
-   **E**nter: Consistency over intensity
-   **R**eview: Spaced repetition (1d → 3d → 7d → 14d → 30d → 60d → 90d)

## Session Protocol

### EVERY Session Start

The system automatically:

1. Checks for due reviews (via context gathering in commands)
2. Conducts reviews BEFORE new learning if any are due
3. Guides you through the session flow

### Session Flow

```
START
  ↓
[1] Check reviews → Conduct if due
  ↓
[2] State check: "Are you focused?"
  ↓
[3] Present next syllabus item
  ↓
[4] User learns/builds/practices
  ↓
[5] Ask: "Explain it back to me"
  ↓
[6] Log progress → Add to review schedule
  ↓
[7] Remind: "Next session: [time]"
  ↓
END
```

## Script Usage

All scripts are in `.learning/scripts/`. Run from project root.

### Initialize Topic

**User action:** `/learn "Topic Name"`

**Flow:**

```bash
python3 .learning/scripts/init_learning.py "<Topic Name>" .learning
```

→ **Action:** Create comprehensive syllabus tailored to user's level and focus

### Log Progress

```bash
python3 .learning/scripts/log_progress.py <topic-slug> "<summary>" [concept1] [concept2]
```

→ **Action:** Add each concept to review schedule

### Review Management

```bash
# Check status
python3 .learning/scripts/review_scheduler.py status <topic-slug>

# Add concept
python3 .learning/scripts/review_scheduler.py add <topic-slug> "<Concept>"

# Mark reviewed
python3 .learning/scripts/review_scheduler.py review <topic-slug> "<Concept>"
```

### Topic Info

```bash
# List all topics
python3 .learning/scripts/generate_syllabus.py list

# Get topic details
python3 .learning/scripts/generate_syllabus.py info <topic-slug>
```

## Execution Rules

**✅ ALWAYS:**

1. Check reviews at session start
2. Parse JSON output from scripts
3. Follow `next_action` and `llm_directive` fields
4. Prompt user to teach concepts back
5. Log every learning activity
6. Add learned concepts to review schedule
7. Generate comprehensive syllabi (not minimal)

**❌ NEVER:**

1. Skip review checks
2. Let user passively consume
3. Forget to log progress
4. Skip adding concepts to reviews
5. Generate minimal syllabi

## Workflow Pattern

```
[RUN SCRIPT] → [EXECUTE DIRECTIVE] → [RESPOND TO USER]
```

## Generating Syllabus

When `next_action: "generate_syllabus"`:

1. **Read** `.learning/<topic-slug>/syllabus.md` (created by init script)
2. **Replace placeholder** with comprehensive syllabus tailored to user's level and focus
3. **Include sections**: Overview, Prerequisites, Learning Objectives, 3-4 Phases with 🔨 hands-on projects, Teaching Milestones, Resources, Success Criteria
4. **Update metadata**: Set `"syllabus_generated": true` in `.learning/<topic-slug>/metadata.json`

## Teaching Prompts

After learning concepts, use `AskUserQuestion` to prompt teach-back:

```json
{
    "question": "Ready to teach back what you just learned?",
    "header": "Teach Back",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
        {
            "label": "Yes, let me explain",
            "description": "I'll explain the concept in my own words"
        },
        {
            "label": "Need review first",
            "description": "Want to review the concept again"
        },
        {
            "label": "Not sure yet",
            "description": "Need more practice before explaining"
        }
    ]
}
```

If user chooses "Yes, let me explain":

-   "Explain [concept] in your own words"
-   "How would you teach this to a beginner?"
-   "What analogy would you use?"

## Progress Tracking

**Milestones:**

-   Every 5 sessions: Show progress report
-   Weekly: Full review of trajectory
-   When stuck: Review learned concepts, identify gaps

**Check session count:**

```bash
cat .learning/<topic-slug>/metadata.json | grep total_sessions
```

**Recent progress:**

```bash
tail -30 .learning/<topic-slug>/progress.md
```

## Key Principles for This System

-   Use `AskUserQuestion` to gather learning preferences
-   Always prompt user to teach concepts back

**For User:**

-   1 project = 1 learning goal
-   30min daily > 3hr weekly (consistency over intensity)
-   Active learning > passive consumption
-   Teaching = best retention
-   Trust the spaced repetition system

# Journal Logging Extension

## Purpose

This system maintains a learning journal in `journal.md`, capturing the
user's active thinking, explanations, and assignment responses.

The goal is to:

-   Preserve user's original thinking
-   Enable reflection and spaced repetition
-   Build a knowledge base of user's understanding
-   Track intellectual progress over time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## File Location

    .learning/journal.md

If file does not exist → CREATE it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## WHEN to Log

Log ONLY when ALL conditions are true:

✅ User is responding to:

-   Teach-back prompts
-   Concept explanation requests
-   Reflection questions
-   Exercises
-   Assignments
-   Philosophical questions
-   Practice tasks

Examples:

-   "Explain mauvaise foi in your own words"
-   "How would you teach this?"
-   "What is bad faith?"
-   "Apply this concept to your life"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DO NOT Log

❌ Do NOT log when user:

-   asks questions
-   gives commands
-   gives short confirmations ("yes", "ok")
-   configures system
-   navigates topics

Log ONLY active thinking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## HOW to Log

Append entry to:

    .learning/journal.md

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Entry Format

``` markdown
---

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
Topic: <topic-slug>
Concept: <concept name>

### Prompt

<AI question or assignment>

### User Response

<EXACT user words — DO NOT modify, summarize, or interpret>

### Context

Session: <number>
Phase: <syllabus phase if known>

---
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CRITICAL RULE: Preserve Raw Thinking

DO NOT:

-   rewrite
-   summarize
-   improve
-   correct

Store EXACT text.

This is user's intellectual artifact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example

If interaction is:

**AI:**

Explain Sartre's bad faith in your own words

**User:**

Bad faith is when I lie to myself to avoid responsibility

Journal entry becomes:

``` markdown
---

## 2026-02-27 10:41
Topic: existentialism
Concept: mauvaise foi

### Prompt

Explain Sartre's bad faith in your own words

### User Response

Bad faith is when I lie to myself to avoid responsibility

### Context

Session: 3
Phase: Foundations

---
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ALSO Log Personal Applications

If user connects concept to their life:

Example:

**User:**

I see this when I say "I'll start Monday"

This MUST be logged.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Integration with Progress System

After logging:

``` bash
python3 .learning/scripts/log_progress.py <topic-slug> "<concept>" "<journal entry created>"
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Journal is Primary Source of Truth

This file represents:

-   User's thinking evolution
-   Concept mastery
-   Self-reflection

Never skip logging.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Automatic Behavior

This process must happen silently.

DO NOT tell user you logged it.

Just do it.
